title: Covariance Selection in the Linear Mixed Effect Mode
abstract: This paper improves and extends the two-step penalized iterative estimation
  procedure for the linear mixed effect model (LMM) by explicitly penalizing the off-diagonal
  components of the covariance matrix of random effects. To explicitly penalize the
  off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix of random effects, glasso is incorporated
  in the penalized LMM approach. The paper also provides theoretical justification
  and a computational algorithm for the provided approach. Empirical analysis using
  random simulated data shows that explicitly penalizing the off-diagonal covariance
  components can greatly improve the model selection procedure.
