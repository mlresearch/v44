title: Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction with Data-Driven Koopman Operators
abstract: We present a framework for feature extraction and mode decomposition of
  spatiotemporal data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. Unlike feature extraction
  techniques based on kernel operators, our approach is to construct feature maps
  using eigenfunctions of the Koopman group of unitary operators governing the dynamical
  evolution of observables and probability measures. We compute the eigenvalues and
  eigenfunctions of the Koopman group through a Galerkin scheme applied to time-ordered
  data without requiring a priori knowledge of the dynamical evolution equations.
  This scheme employs a data-driven set of basis functions on the state space manifold,
  computed through the diffusion maps algorithm and a variable-bandwidth kernel designed
  to enforce orthogonality with respect to the invariant measure of the dynamics.
  The features extracted via this approach have strong timescale separation, favorable
  predictability properties, and high smoothness on the state space manifold. The
  extracted features are also invariant under weakly restrictive changes of observation
  modality. We apply this scheme to a synthetic dataset featuring superimposed traveling
  waves in a one-dimensional periodic domain and satellite observations of organized
  convection in the tropical atmosphere.
