title: A Survey of Modern Questions and Challenges in Feature Extraction
abstract: The problem of extracting features from given data is of critical importance
  for successful application of machine learning. Feature extraction, as usually understood,
  seeks an optimal transformation from input data into a (typically real-valued) feature
  vector that can be used as an input for a learning algorithm. Over time, this problem
  has been attacked using a growing number of diverse techniques that originated in
  separate research communities, including feature selection, dimensionality reduction,
  manifold learning, distance metric learning and representation learning. The goal
  of this paper is to contrast and compare feature extraction techniques coming from
  different machine learning areas, discuss the modern challenges and open problems
  in feature extraction and suggest novel solutions to some of them.
