title: A Computationally Efficient Method for Estimating Semi Parametric Regression
  Functions
abstract: Bias reduction is an important condition for effective feature extraction.
  Utilizing recent theoretical results in high dimensional statistical modeling, we
  propose a model-free yet computationally simple approach to estimate the partially
  linear model Y=XÎ²+g(Z)+\varepsilon. Based on partitioning the support of Z, a simple
  local average is used to  approximate the response surface g(Z). The model can be
  estimated via least squares and no tuning parameter is needed. The proposed method
  seeks to strike a balance between computation burden and efficiency of the estimators
  while minimizing model bias. The desired theoretical properties of the proposed
  estimators are established.  Moreover, since the proposed method bypasses data-driven
  bandwith selection of traditional nonparametric methods, it avoids the further efficiency
  loss due to computation burden.
