title: Hierarchical Feature Extraction for Efficient Design of Microfluidic Flow Patterns
abstract: Deep neural networks are being widely used for feature representation learning
  in diverse problem areas ranging from object recognition and speech recognition
  to robotic perception and human disease prediction. We demonstrate a novel, perhaps
  the first application of deep learning in mechanical design, specifically to learn
  complex microfluidic flow patterns in order to solve inverse problems in fluid mechanics.
  A recent discovery showed the ability to control the fluid deformations in a microfluidic
  channel by placing a sequence of pillars. This provides a fundamental tool for numerous
  material science, manufacturing and biological applications. However, designing
  pillar sequences for user-defined deformations is practically infeasible as the
  current process requires laborious and time-consuming design iterations in a very
  large, highly nonlinear design space that can have as large as 10^15 possibilities.
  We demonstrate that hierarchical feature extraction can potentially lead to a scalable
  design tool via learning semantic representations from a relatively small number
  of flow pattern examples. The paper compares the performances of pre-trained deep
  neural networks and deep convolutional neural networks as well as their learnt features.
  We show that a balanced training data generation process with respect to a metric
  on the output space improves the feature extraction performance. Overall, the deep
  learning based design process is shown to expedite the current state-of-the-art
  design approaches by more than 600 times.
