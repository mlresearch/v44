title: Modular Autoencoders for Ensemble Feature Extraction
abstract: 'We introduce the concept of a Modular Autoencoder (MAE), capable of learning
  a set of diverse but complementary representations from unlabelled data, that can
  later be used for supervised tasks. The learning of the representations is controlled
  by a trade-off parameter, and we show on six benchmark datasets the optimum lies
  between two extremes: a set of smaller, independent autoencoders each with low capacity,
  versus a single monolithic encoding, outperforming an appropriate baseline. In the
  present paper we explore the special case of linear MAE, and derive an SVD-based
  algorithm which converges several orders of magnitude faster than gradient descent.'
