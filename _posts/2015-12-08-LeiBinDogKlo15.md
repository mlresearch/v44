title: Theory and Algorithms for the Localized Setting of Learning Kernels
abstract: We analyze the localized setting of learning kernels also known as localized
  multiple kernel learning. This problem has been addressed in the past using rather
  heuristic approaches based on approximately optimizing non-convex problem formulations,
  of which up to now no theoretical learning bounds are known. In this paper, we show
  generalization error bounds for learning localized kernel classes where the localities
  are  coupled using graph-based regularization. We propose a novel learning localized
  kernels algorithm based on this hypothesis  class that is formulated as a convex
  optimization problem using a pre-obtained cluster structure of the data. We derive
  dual representations using Fenchel conjugation theory, based on which we give a
  simple yet efficient wrapper-based optimization algorithm. We apply the method to
  problems involving multiple heterogeneous data sources, taken from domains of computational
  biology and computer vision. The results show that the proposed convex approach
  to learning localized kernels can achieve higher prediction accuracies than its
  global and non-convex local counterparts.
