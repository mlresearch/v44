title: Learning Sparse Metrics, One Feature at a Time
abstract: 'Learning distance metrics from data is a fundamental problem in machine
  learning and useful way to extract data-driven features by using the matrix root
  of a distance matrix. Finding a proper metric amounts to optimization over the cone
  of positive definite (PD) matrices. This optimization is difficult since restricting
  optimization to remain within the PD cone or repeatedly projecting to the cone is
  prohibitively costly. Here we describe COMET, a block-coordinate descent procedure,
  which efficiently keeps the search within the PD cone, avoiding both costly projections
  and unnecessary computation of full gradients. COMET also continuously maintains
  the Cholesky root of the matrix, providing feature extraction and embedding of samples
  in a metric space. We further develop a structurally sparse variant of COMET, where
  only a small number of features interacts with other features. Sparse-COMET significantly
  accelerates both training and inference while improving interpretability. As a block-coordinate
  descent procedure, COMET has fast convergence bounds showing linear convergence
  with high probability. When tested on benchmark datasets in a task of retrieving
  similar images and similar text documents, COMET has significantly better precision
  than competing projection-free methods. Furthermore, sparse-COMET achieves almost
  identical precision as dense-COMET in document classification, while running 4.5
  times faster, maintaining a 0.5% sparsity level, and outperforming competing methods
  both in precision and in run time. '
