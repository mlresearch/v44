title: Learning Multi-channel Deep Feature Representations for Face Recognition
abstract: "Deep learning provides a natural way to obtain feature representations
  from data without relying on hand-crafted descriptors. In this paper, we propose
  to learn deep feature representations using unsupervised and supervised learning
  in a cascaded fashion to produce generically descriptive yet class speci\fc features.
  The proposed method can take full advantage of the availability of large-scale unlabeled
  data and learn discriminative features (supervised) from generic features (unsupervised).
  It is then applied to multiple essential facial regions to obtain multi-channel
  deep facial representations for face recognition. The effecacy of the proposed feature
  representations is validated on both controlled (i.e., extended Yale- B, Yale, and
  AR) and uncontrolled (PubFig) benchmark face databases. Experimental results show
  its effectiveness."
