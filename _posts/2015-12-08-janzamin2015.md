title: 'FEAST at Play: Feature ExtrAction using Score function Tensors'
abstract: Feature learning forms the cornerstone for tackling challenging learning
  problems in domains such as speech, computer vision and natural language processing.
  In this paper, we build upon a novel framework called FEAST(Feature ExtrAction using
  Score function Tensors) which incorporates   generative models  for discriminative
  learning. FEAST considers a novel class of matrix and tensor-valued feature transform,
  which can be pre-trained using unlabeled samples. It uses an efficient algorithm
  for extracting discriminative information, given these pre-trained features and
  labeled samples for any related task. The class of   features it adopts are based
  on higher-order score functions, which capture local variations in the probability
  density function of the input.  We employ efficient spectral decomposition algorithms
  (on matrices and tensors) for extracting discriminative components. The advantage
  of employing tensor-valued features is that we can extract richer discriminative
  information in the form of overcomplete representations (where number of discriminative
  features is greater than input dimension). In this paper, we provide preliminary
  experiment results on real datasets.
